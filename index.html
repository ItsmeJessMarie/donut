      A doughnut or donut is a type of food made from leavened fried dough. It
      is popular in many countries and is prepared in various forms as a sweet
      snack that can be homemade or purchased in bakeries, supermarkets, food
      stalls, and franchised specialty vendors. Doughnut is the traditional
      spelling, while donut is the simplified version; the terms are used
      interchangeably.
